    <h1>About Richard Mora</h1>
    <p>As you know my name is Richard Mora. I'm currently a student here at Clark College and a panstry cook for the Hilton Vancouver Washington. I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, getting back into reading and when I took my first programming course here at Clark I begin to enjoy working with codes on my laptop or computer. At first I was a bit anxious when I went back to college after 10 plus years since I last attended college but now I look forward to class every week.</p>

    <h2>My goals for this class</h2>
    <p>My main thing I want to accomplish in this class is to be able to understand and perform tasks that involves using JavaScript whether it for a web page or a application. Also to learn what you're able to do using the other forms of JavaScript like node.js and react.js and what makes them popular.</p>

    <h2>Programming Skill Level</h2>
    <p>Thought I'm still a beginner to programming, I learn enough to know what a html, css, python and a little JavaScript file looks like and understand what it produces. Out of the three languages that are listed below, I enjoy learning and using Python the most follow by HTML. These are the following languages I know in list form:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
